About the Documentation Project
===============================

The ImGui ReadTheDocs documentation effort began and is currently maintained by __Conner Turmon__ <conerturmon@gmail.com> after struggling to find solid documentation on the API. While the github repository, YouTube videos, and the source code itself offered scattered sources of a knowledge base, a more centralized form of documentation was a necessity.

This documentation is an ongoing project to provide information on both the User-Interface side of the API, as well as the inner workings for those interested in configuring, extending, or modifying their ImGui distribution.

A __vast__ majority of the documentation provided is simply a reformat of information provided by the ImGui developers in the source code itself, as the source code provides particularly excellent documentation on everything that makes up ImGui. Many props to those who have contributed and provided detailed explanations of the data structures, user-end methods, etc., as this centralized documentation would not be possible without it.

If you have any concerns about the documentation provided or you would like to reach out to one of the main developers, head over to [the Contact page](contact.md) for more information.
