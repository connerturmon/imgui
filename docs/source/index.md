Dear ImGui Documentation
========================

Welcome to the Dear ImGui Documentation hub. This project is currently under construction, but you may still find tons of useful information here.
If you would like to contribute, reach out to the current maintainer __Conner Turmon__ <connerturmon@gmail.com>.

Currently there are no guides available on this site, but there is plenty of documentation on the raw API which you can find on the sidebar. You can of course also find plenty of information on [the official DearImGui repository](https://www.github.com/ocornut/imgui) as well.
